function k = dense_gauss_kernel(sigma, x, y)
%DENSE_GAUSS_KERNEL Gaussian Kernel with dense sampling.
%   Evaluates a gaussian kernel with bandwidth SIGMA for all displacements
%   between input images X and Y, which must both be MxN. They must also
%   be periodic (ie., pre-processed with a cosine window). The result is
%   an MxN map of responses.
%
%   If X and Y are the same, ommit the third parameter to re-use some
%   values, which is faster.
