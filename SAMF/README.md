# A Scale Adaptive Kernel Correlation Filter Tracker with Feature Integration (SAMF)
This is the matlab code of SAMF[1]. It won the second place in [VOT 2014](http://votchallenge.net/vot2014/index.html). The implementation is built upon the code of [2]. The codes provided by [3,4,5] are also used in the implementation. 

## Instructions:
* 1) Modify the base_path in "run_tracker.m" with your own setting.
* 2) Run the "run_tracker.m" script in MATLAB.
* 3) Choose sequence.
