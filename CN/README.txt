This MATLAB code is an implementation of the visual tracking method proposed in [1]. The implementation is built upon the code provided by [2]. The code provided by [3] is used for computing the color name representation.

The project website is:
http://www.cvl.isy.liu.se/research/objrec/colvistrack/index.html

Instructions:
1) Run the "run_tracker.m" script in MATLAB.
2) Choose sequence (only "deer" is included).
